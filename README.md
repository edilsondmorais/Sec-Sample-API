    docker run -p 8080:8080 my-sample-api:1.0

## Deploy using GitHub Actions

    - We will store the image on docker hub.
    - We run the application usng a free tier account on Okteto (https://www.okteto.com/) You can create an acount an deploy some workload on the freetier, it will run for 24 hours.
        - More details on: https://www.okteto.com/pricing/
To use this pipeline, you will need a free acount on DockerHUb and on Okteto.

### Adjustments:

On your Repository, set the following secrets:

        secrets.DOCKERHUB_LOGIN         # Your DockerHUB Login
        secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASS          # Your DockerHUB Password
        secrets.OKTETO_API_KEY          # Your Oketeto API Key

    On the file .github/workflows/main.yaml

    Set your repository name for image hosting (Mys are edilsondmorais for exmaple)
        tags: |
                edilsondmorais/api_conversao:latest
                edilsondmorais/api_conversao:${{ github.run_number }}

    With this you should be able to Go.
